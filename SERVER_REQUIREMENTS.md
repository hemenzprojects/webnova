## Deployment Timeline:

Once I have access, deployment will take approximately:
- Docker method: 1-2 hours
- Traditional method: 2-4 hours

This includes:
- Initial setup and configuration
- Database migrations
- SSL certificate setup
- Testing all features

---

## Post-Deployment Needs:

After deployment, I will need:
- Access to view logs (for debugging)
- Ability to restart services (for updates)
- Database backup schedule (your recommendation?)

---

## Security Considerations:

- All sensitive data will be stored in `.env` files (not in git)
- File permissions will be set according to best practices
- I will enable firewall rules as needed
- Regular security updates will be applied

## Questions for Server Admin:

1. Is Docker allowed on this server?
2. Do you have a preferred backup solution?
3. Are there any security policies I should be aware of?
4. Do you provide monitoring/alerting services?
5. What's your preferred deployment method?
